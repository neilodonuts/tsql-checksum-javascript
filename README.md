T-SQL's CHECKSUM() algorithm reverse engineered and implemented in JavaScript

Apologies in advance but you will not yet find the work finished here. I'm
working on it or rather planning to work on it but I needed to have something to
work on so I created this repo. If you'd like to help me, drop me a line!

## Background

This is going to get messy!

I got started on this quest after posting what I thought was an innocuous
question on StackOverflow:

[How to Implement T-SQL CHECKSUM() in JavaScript for BigQuery?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58980138/)

A semi-helpful comment appeared soon after with
[a link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16316009/) that led me down a
rabbit-hole and not too much after a downvote and a comment telling me quite
frankly *NOT* to use this dated and terrible hash function. I then spent the
remaining work day attempting to figure out the shoddy algorithm which
none-the-less is a practically immortal part of Microsoft SQL Server. Knowing
precisely how it works, I reasoned, would be helpful to anyone whether they're
maintaining code that uses it or simply needing convincing why not to use it.

Near the end of the day I found that the SQL code posted for the algorithm
([from 2006 on sqlteam.com](https://www.sqlteam.com/forums/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=70832))
is actually for `BINARY_CHECKSUM()` rather than `CHECKSUM()`. Doh! This repo
will *not* be for that function for which code has already been created that
seems to work in my brief tests of it.

I played with various XOR'ing and ROL'ing with a few letters and numbers and
although I didn't come up with a solution I did clearly see that there is a
pattern. My initial focus will be on ASCII (VARCHAR) and then I'll move onto
Unicode (NVARCHAR).

As soon as I can figure out how to put some nice tables into this README, I'll
add some information about the patterns I've seen. At a glance I'll say that
the first character generates a byte-long value (8 bits) and then new characters
shift that a nibble (4 bits) to the left. The bits on the left remain the same
while the ones on the right change. When I experimented with `O0` and `0O`
(opposites in terms of lower nibble bits) I noticed that the 12 bits reflected
two perfectly opposite 6-bit pairs.

## SQL Server in VirtualBox

I'm running SQL Server (Express) in VirtualBox on a Windows 10 VM. This is a
[free thing provided by Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines)
but it's not without hazards. I routinely mess up the configuration so that I
am unable to connect to it. So here's my reference checklist:

  1. NAT port forwarding for 1433 on VirtualBox: use 127.0.0.1 on host and blank on guest so that port is only open to the host itself.
  2. TCP/IP protocol enabled in SQL Server Configuration Manager.
  3. Windows Firewall rule to allow SQL Server (or turned off) on _both_ public and private networks,.
  4. SQL Server Browser service is enabled and automatically started. 

I set this up myself and later found a [nice tutorial on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37616522/9642).
